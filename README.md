## Getting Started

Include instructions on how to set up the project locally. This could involve cloning the repository, installing dependencies, setting up environment variables, etc.

## Sessions with express-session

Explain the concept of sessions and how they are managed using `express-session`. Cover session configuration, middleware setup, and any best practices.

## Authentication Strategies
